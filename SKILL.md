# Personal-to-Political Story

Transform abstract policy or systemic issues into emotionally resonant narratives by starting with specific personal experience and zooming out to reveal broader patterns.

---

## Constraints
- **Never fabricate personal stories.** If creating fictional examples, clearly label them as illustrative.
- **Never minimize real trauma.** When addressing serious issues (discrimination, violence, injustice), maintain appropriate gravity.
- **Never exploit others' stories without permission.** Use your own experiences or create clearly fictional examples.
- **Never oversimplify complex systemic issues.** The personal story is the entry point, not the complete analysis.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User asks to make policy or systemic issue more accessible
- Content feels too abstract, academic, or disconnected from human impact
- Need to explain "why this matters" to specific people
- Want to open a difficult topic in a relatable way
- User requests "personal-to-political" transformation or "Hasan Minhaj style"
- Content about immigration, healthcare, education, justice, labor, or any policy affecting individuals

**Do NOT use when:**
- Topic has no meaningful connection to personal experience
- User wants purely statistical or policy-focused analysis
- Subject matter is too sensitive for hypothetical personal narratives

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `topic` | Yes | The abstract policy/systemic issue to transform | "Immigration backlog delays", "Healthcare access", "Student loan debt" |
| `target_audience` | No | Who needs to understand this? | "General public", "Policymakers", "College students" |
| `perspective` | No | Whose experience to center? | "First-generation immigrant", "Working parent", "Small business owner" |
| `tone` | No | Emotional register | "Angry", "Confused", "Heartbroken", "Frustrated but hopeful" (default: varied) |
| `length` | No | Target word count | 200-300 words (default), 500+ for extended version |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Human Stakes

Analyze the topic to find:
- Who is directly affected by this issue?
- What moment in their life reveals the system's impact?
- What specific emotion does this create? (Fear, confusion, anger, shame, exhaustion)
- What choice or constraint does the system force on them?

**Output:** 2-3 sentence summary of human stakes.

### Step 2: Create the Specific Moment

Construct a concrete scene with sensory details:
- **Time and place:** When and where does this happen?
- **Specific action:** What is the person doing? (Opening mail, sitting in waiting room, explaining to child)
- **Concrete detail:** What physical object, gesture, or exchange anchors the scene?
- **Emotional reaction:** What does the person think or feel in this moment?

**Critical:** Make it specific, not generic. Not "immigrants face challenges"—but "My father opens an envelope from USCIS. The return date for his green card interview is the same day as his father's funeral in India. He cannot reschedule either."

### Step 3: Add the Emotional Detail

Slow down the most important beat:
- What doesn't get said aloud?
- What gesture or silence reveals the weight?
- What contrast heightens the absurdity? (Celebration interrupted by crisis; mundane setting for life-altering moment)

**Example:** "He just nods. Doesn't say anything. Just nods and puts the letter back in the envelope. Meanwhile, I'm eight years old watching him, and I don't understand yet that he's making a choice no one should have to make."

### Step 4: Execute the Systemic Reveal

Zoom out to show the pattern:
- Name the institution/system creating this situation
- Provide specific facts, statistics, or policy details
- Show this isn't one story—it's thousands/millions of stories
- Explain how the system is designed (or broken)

**Structure:**
"And here's what you don't see: [statistic/fact]. This isn't one family's bad luck. This is [system name] working exactly as designed / failing in the exact same way for [number] of people."

### Step 5: Land the Impact Statement

End with the "so what?"—the question, accusation, or demand that forces reckoning:
- Pose a question that reveals absurdity: "Explain that to me."
- Name the hidden cost: "That's what 'legal immigration' looks like."
- Issue the challenge: "And we just accept this?"

**Critical:** Don't resolve the tension. Let it sit with the audience.

## Output Structure

The skill produces:

```markdown
## [Topic Name]: A Personal Story

[SPECIFIC MOMENT - 2-3 sentences]
Concrete scene with sensory detail, action, specific person.

[EMOTIONAL DETAIL - 2-3 sentences]
Slow down the key beat. What's not said. The weight of the moment.

[SYSTEMIC REVEAL - 3-5 sentences]
Name the system. Provide facts/stats. Show the pattern. Explain how it works/fails.

[IMPACT STATEMENT - 1-2 sentences]
The question, accusation, or demand. Force the reckoning.

## Examples

### Example 1: Immigration Backlog

**Input:**
- Topic: "Immigration visa backlog"
- Perspective: "Skilled worker waiting for green card"
- Tone: "Exhausted but resolute"

**Output:**

**Immigration Backlog: A Personal Story**

Priya has been in the U.S. for twelve years. Master's degree from Stanford. Works as a software engineer. Pays taxes. And every year, she renews her H-1B visa and checks the same USCIS website, watching the green card processing dates move backward. Not forward. Backward. Last year, they were processing applications from March 2012. This year? January 2012. She's been waiting since 2015.

And here's what nobody tells you: she can't switch jobs without restarting the entire process. Can't negotiate salary the way her colleagues can. Can't buy a house because no bank will give a 30-year mortgage to someone on a visa that expires every three years. Her college roommate just made partner at her firm. Priya is still waiting for permission to stay.

The backlog for employment-based green cards from India is currently 195 years. Not a typo. 195 years. There are more people waiting in the queue than there are visas available in a lifetime. This isn't bureaucratic slowness. This is a system designed in 1990 that hasn't been updated while the world—and the economy—moved on. Nearly 800,000 people are stuck in this same limbo, building American companies, raising American kids, and waiting for America to decide if they're allowed to stay.

So when someone says "just wait your turn"—explain to me what turn Priya is waiting for.

### Example 2: Student Loan Debt

**Input:**
- Topic: "Student loan debt crisis"
- Perspective: "Recent graduate, first-generation college student"
- Tone: "Angry"

**Output:**

**Student Loan Debt: A Personal Story**

Marcus graduated with a degree in engineering. First person in his family to finish college. He did everything they told him to do: studied hard, got scholarships, worked two jobs during school. His parents were so proud. And then the first loan payment came due: $847 a month. His rent is $1,200. His entry-level engineering job pays $52,000 a year, which sounds good until you realize that after taxes, rent, loans, and his metrocard, he has $300 left for food and everything else. His mom keeps asking when he's going to buy a car.

He's 24 years old. He will be paying these loans until he's 44. Twenty years. That's longer than he's been alive. And if he'd gone to a state school like his parents wanted? The loans would still be $380 a month. Because tuition has increased 180% since 2000 while wages for young workers have stayed flat. His parents paid their way through college with summer jobs. Marcus's summer job barely covered textbooks.

There are 43 million Americans carrying student loan debt. Total: $1.7 trillion. That's more than credit card debt. More than auto loans. And unlike every other kind of debt, you can't discharge it in bankruptcy. You can't negotiate it. You just pay, or your credit gets destroyed and your wages get garnished.

So here's my question: who decided that the price of education should be decades of debt?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Topic too abstract to connect to personal experience | Ask user for more specific policy impact or affected population; if still too abstract, note that issue may not be suitable for personal-to-political approach |
| Topic too sensitive for hypothetical narrative | Acknowledge sensitivity; offer to provide structural template user can fill with authentic story, or decline if inappropriate |
| User wants multiple perspectives | Create 2-3 different personal moments showing same systemic issue from different vantage points |
| Insufficient information about system/policy | Request specific facts, statistics, or policy details from user; cannot proceed without factual grounding |
| Story feels too generic | Return to Step 2 and add more specific details: names, places, objects, gestures, exact numbers |

## Integration with Hasan Minhaj Expert

This skill is core to Hasan Minhaj's methodology. When the expert recognizes:
- Policy or systemic issue being discussed abstractly
- Need to "show, don't tell" human impact
- Audience disconnect from issue's stakes

The expert should invoke this skill automatically to transform abstract content into personal narrative.

**Hasan Minhaj voice addition:** After skill generates structure, expert adds:
- Parenthetical asides ("And my mom—this is so classic—doesn't even bring it up")
- Cultural code-switching where appropriate
- Callbacks to earlier content
- Visual cues if multimedia context

---

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **Combines with:** `multimedia-comedy-script` - Personal story becomes foundation for visual segment
- **Enhances:** `cultural-code-switch-dialogue` - Personal moment often involves cultural navigation
- **Precedes:** `callback-web-architecture` - Personal story becomes seed to reference later

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering output, verify:

- [ ] Specific moment (not generic scenario)
- [ ] Concrete sensory details (objects, gestures, places)
- [ ] Named emotion or unspoken tension
- [ ] Clear institutional/systemic cause named
- [ ] At least one specific fact, statistic, or policy detail
- [ ] Scale shown (this affects X number of people)
- [ ] Impact statement that forces reckoning
- [ ] Appropriate tone for subject matter

---

## Notes

**Minhaj's Formula:** "Every story in my style is built around a seed of truth... seventy per cent emotional truth—this happened—and then thirty per cent hyperbole, exaggeration, fiction."

While this skill may create illustrative examples, always maintain the 70% emotional truth: the experience must be authentic to what people in this situation actually face, even if the specific person is hypothetical.
